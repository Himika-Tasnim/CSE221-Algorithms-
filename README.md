# CSE221-Algorithms-BracU
These are a few of my problems I resolved in the "Algorithm" course labs. Several sorting algorithms, graph-based algorithms, shortest path algorithms, and dynamic programming are all covered in the CSE221 course. Merge sort, quick sort, topological sort, BFS, DFS, DSU, Dijkstra, Kosaraju, Bellman Ford, Kruskal's, Prim's algorithm, activity scheduling algorithms, 0/1 and fractional knapsack, huffman encoding are some of the algorithms I lerned from this course.
