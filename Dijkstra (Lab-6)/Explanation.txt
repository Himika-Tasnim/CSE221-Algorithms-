Task-1:
1. At first cosidered (0,source node) as the first element of heap.
2. Loop till there is at least one element in the heap. 
3. In each iteration poped element of heap is the source & then called dijkstra function.
4. In dijksta function checked if we can find a distance that is less than the previously assigned distance of that node. 
5. printed -1 if unreachable.

Task-2:
1. Implemented dijkstra twice and found two paths. One for Alice and another for Bob.
2. if the max(time of reaching a node by bob,alice) is less than time, then changed the value of time. 
3. In this way found the minimum time and expected node.
4. If we cannot go to any place from the source node then its Impossible to find the output.

Task-3:
1. Same as task 1. But instead of adding the danger of the source , took the max of darnger(source, current node)
